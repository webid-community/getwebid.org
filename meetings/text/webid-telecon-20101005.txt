Topic: WebID updates/news

New community repo: http://github.com/webid-community/
first news item: Stephan working on WebID community repository
Stephane Corlosquet
no payment
for github
WebID response from news industry companies
manu talked to major news agencies about webid
News industry felt threatened by WebID
They needed demographics on their customers which they get 
              from the forms people fill in
so if they could have something where people can guarantee 
              demographics info they would be more interested
so the threat is that their competitors can gather their 
              demographic information that they can't
So answer is: 
 - micropayments solution
 - people will be able to access to their news
 - decentralises identity to large competitors don't know
WebID response from music industry companies
positive feedback from music industry
they'll use it when it's done
Henry: Sometimes it is easier for smaller players to take the 
               risk than the larger companies.
Henry: Went to Open Web Conference... 
Henry: Person behind GNU Public LIcense gave a talk
Henry: Eben Moglen
noted that some are more likely to come along for 
               good ethical purposes.
Henry: You need a good bit of thinking on ethics/values for 
               something like WebID - we are seeing goodwill because of that.
Henry: When people hear about WebID, they recognize it and 
               it's more present than it was a year ago.
Henry: I got webid.info - just put it up.
Henry: We have a virtual server at DERI
Manu: Let's merge getwebid.info and webid.info into the same 
               site
Manu: put it up at webid.info
Henry: Do we have an interesting demo to use WebID with git 
               or svn?
Manu: I don't think we do at the moment.
I've used the keys with git last night..
presbrey has done svn + webid
ah yes
apologies, half here, wanted to join tonight but parents evening 
            @ school in half an hour

Topic: Differentiate between the identifying agent and the 
               user operating the identifying agent

http://github.com/webid-community/webid-spec/issues#issue/11
Manu: What does the Identifying Agent represent?
Henry: It's really just whatever you say it is in the FOAF 
               file - there could be a subclass for user agents
Henry: We may need WebIDs for robots in the future.
Henry: Relation from a Person to a User Agent.
Henry: Companies could have User Agents that is a crawler - 
               which has its own WebID.

Topic: Simplify how public keys are expressed

http://github.com/webid-community/webid-spec/issues#issue/12
Henry: There is an image that I put up today concerning this
Henry: There are so many ways of doing this - we may not want 
               to anticipate what people want.
Henry: We don't want to simplify too early.

request we gauge consensus in the community, as a single simple 
            issue, without mixing it up with other issues, just "webid with 
            one triple, yes or no", strawpoll/vote whatever, then discuss 
            again
Henry: Need a link from a user to a public key to simplify
webr3 has to shoot :( /gone
Henry: Dan is willing to add something to FOAF if PKI is 
               useful to FOAF
Manu: It would be nice to see a simpler mechanism than we 
               have now.
Henry: Dan wants pointer from foaf:publicKey to DER-encoded 
               string.
Henry: Maybe DSA?
Manu: RSA seems to be working for most people.
:me cert:controls "ASDASD"^^cert:derEncoding .
Henry: So, it's just a couple of additions to a vocabulary - 
               this might be nice to have.
Manu: We want to be careful to not complicate this too much - 
               implementations need to remain simple.
Henry: Yes, well PGP people might want something more in 
               there. If Identica comes along and says they need one 
               relation to one thing, we can point them to foaf:publicKey.
Henry: Others might come in and request something like 
               facebook:publicKey - we shouldn't guess, if they start 
               publishing public keys, we'll discuss it at that point.
